====================================
   All the FOSS Compliance Tools
====================================

This repo is shared content from and for the FOSS license and security
compliance tools workshop, before FOSDEM: https://workshop.aboutcode.org

The main, emerging attraction is a structured catalog of (eventually) all the FOSS compliance tools.

To contribute your tool, submit a new "Add FOSS Compliance Tool" issue
https://github.com/aboutcode-org/workshop/issues/new

PRs are welcomed to improve the form!


Usage
=====

For now, the data comes as a list of structured issues with summaries, links and features and capabilities
of useful FOSS tools that help with license and security compliance.

See https://github.com/aboutcode-org/workshop/issues

Later, we will create scripts to make this available in other formats (CSV, JSON) and as a living
FOSS compliance tool landscape.
